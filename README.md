         <h1><a href="https://project-foxtrot.herokuapp.com/" class="link-primary">foxtrot</a>: a web-based mental health tracker</h1>
         <h2>The problem: itâ€™s easy to lose track of ourselves. </h2>
         <ul> 
            <li>Stress, anxiety, or depression make it harder to be self-aware.</li>
            <li>But self-awareness is the key to mental health.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The solution: daily text reminders to check-in. </h2>
         <ul> 
            <li>Each text has a link to a unique URL where you can log how you feel that day and view past entries.</li>
            <li>Unsubscribe at any time.</li>
        </ul>
